# StackDash

StackDash is a python3 script designed to automate Docker installation on Ubuntu and deploy container stacks with subdomain hosting. StackDash features a 
Docker-Engine install script and Docker web-app containers/stack deployment wizards. All StackDash containers/stacks are preconfigured for external, subdomain 
access, using LetsEncrypt HTTPS/TLS and OAuth 2.0 SSO via the Google Cloud Platform. See the Documentation for installation instructions.


Please Note: this version of StackDash is configured to support only Cloudflare DNS-managed domains. Additional domain/hosting providers will be made available in future 
releases of StackDash. For a full list of planned DNS providers see: https://docs.traefik.io/https/acme/#providers.
